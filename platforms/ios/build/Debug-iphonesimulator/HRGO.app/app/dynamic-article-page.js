Those programs are listed on the PSC Web site under 'PSC-approved programs.'<*Article_Body*>Where a program encompasses both mandatory and optional work terms, only those mandatory for graduation may be completed in the Public Service of Canada.<*Article_H3*>Does a learning plan for Co-op/Internship students have to be prepared?<*Article_Body*>Yes, the TBS Student Employment Policy requires that learning plans be prepared for each assignment.

The articulation which is provided in writing, also identified the individual selected for appointment.  There are a minimum of two elements contained in the Articulation of Selection Decision, as outlined in the Guide to the ADM HR-Civ Directive, Appointments :<*Article_List*>A brief explanation for the choice of staffing process; and<*Article_List*>The name of the selected candidate and confirmation that they meet the essential merit criteria of the position being staffed.<*Article_Body*>The Articulation of Selection Decision also includes other factors that were considered, such as employee recruitment and retention plans, succession planning, EE representation, etc. The Articulation confirms that the decision is free from political influence and personal favoritism. Please see an example of an Articulation document on the NSHT Student Talent Acquisition SharePoint site for guidance. <*Article_H3*>Why is it recommended that I anticipate 25 business days between the day the LOO is issued and the employee’s expected Start Date?  <*Article_Body*>The TBS Service Standards outlines these recommendations in order to avoid issues with pay. <*Article_H3*>If a candidate has completed all program requirements but does not have proof of graduation (diploma) at the time of appointment, what do I do?<*Article_Body*> Proof of program completion can include documents such as a diploma, transcript, or a letter from the educational institution. The document must clearly confirm that the academic program has been completed and the graduation date. The manager must validate this information and confirm that the candidate has met this merit criteria as an essential part of the Hiring of a Former Student staffing file. <*Article_H3*>Do I have to provide proof of citizenship and diploma? <*Article_Body*>As per the Public Service Employment Act, Canadian citizens are to be considered for positions before non-Canadians. Confirmation of the candidate’s Canadian citizenship is a file requirement. However, personal documentation is not to be kept on the staffing file. Written confirmation from the hiring manager will suffice.<*Article_Body*>Similarly, proof of program completion, such as a diploma, is an essential part of a Hiring of a Former Student file. The manager needs not provide a copy of the diploma, however written confirmation that the manager has validated the Education Qualification is a file requirement. Note that in certain high-risk professions, the manager may require more tangible proof of education credentials in assessing this merit criterion, in which case, copies of these credentials, or that the credentials have been viewed, would need to be retained on the staffing file. <*Article_H3*>What is a Conditional Letter of Offer? <*Article_Body*>A conditional letter of offer is a conditional employment offer. However, before the appointment can be made, merit must be completely assessed, all requirements of the conditional offer must be met (e.g., completion of degree, further testing, conditions of employment such as security) and the oath of the public service administered. The candidate cannot commence employment until they meet all conditions.<*Article_Body*>Persons with a Priority Entitlement must be considered first and priority clearance must be received before a conditional letter of offer can be issued. <*Article_H3*>Why does my Merit Criteria require so much change? <*Article_Body*>Candidates for Hiring of a Former Student appointments have the potential for excellent careers in the Public Service. However they often do not have extensive experience. The NSHT recommends that the merit criteria of your position focus on the personal competencies required for the position, rather than thorough experience and knowledge criteria which can be acquired on the job. Through a review of your draft merit criteria, your NSHT Staffing Advisor may also identify redundancies in the Essential Qualifications which the former student would likely meet given their recent completion of an educational program. An added benefit to this approach is that it streamlines your assessment process. <*Article_H3*>Tell me about Security Screening<*Article_Body*>The security requirement of a position is a Condition of Employment, which the candidate must meet prior to being appointed. Specific to positions requiring access to classified information and assets, note that the security requirements of a position cannot be downgraded to facilitate the hiring process (National Defence Security Orders and Directives - Chapter 4).  Please contact your Unit Security Supervisor (USS) to initiate the security screening process, or transfer from another government department. Please see the DGDS website for more information. <*Article_H3*>Where can I find information regarding minimum Qualification Standards? <*Article_Body*>All appointments are bound by the Qualification Standards for employment in the core public administration as determined by TBS for each employment group and classification. The merit criteria of the position must reflect both the applicable Qualification Standard and the eligibility requirements for the Hiring of a Former Student staffing mechanism – meaning, the candidate must have had graduated from a recognized education institution within 60 months of appointment.<*Article_H3*>Why should my employee start on the first day of a pay period? <*Article_Body*>Having your employee start on the first day of a pay period will allow the employee to receive a full two-week salary on his first pay. As we are paid in arrears, starting an employee on a Monday or on a non-pay week would result in additional wait time before your employee sees a full payment.<*Article_Body*>With this being said, for term employment, the first day of a pay period is not as significant as the employee being terminated on the final day of a pay period. In this case, the employee is not left waiting for their final payment.<*Article_H3*>If my employee is experiencing a delay in pay, what could be the reason?<*Article_Body*>Timeliness is of the essence. DND is solely responsible for entering the hire/rehire of an employee. For the appointment to be completed and for pay to start, the data entry needs to be completed by HR and all the paperwork must be submitted to the Pay Centre in a timely manner. This includes the return of the Letter of Offer, as well as all other required documents such as the Oath, direct deposit, tax forms, etc. The Public Service Pay Centre (PSPC) has established a service standard of 20 working days for starting and stopping pay. If an employee still hasn’t received a payment after the 20 working day period, they are entitled to request an Emergency Salary Advance (ESA)."};
